## Why steno?

- speed
  - average typist = 40wpm
  - top QWERTY typist = 120wpm
  - speech = 180wpm
  - steno students = 100-120wpm (in 6mths)
  - certified stenographer = 240wpm @ 99.9% accuracy
  - world record = 360wpm @ 97.23% accuracy
- ergonomics
  - fingers mostly at home position
  - even better than DVORAK and COLEMAK
- makes your brain work faster?
  - same as what the abacus does for mental arithmetic
