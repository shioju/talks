# Byzantine Generals Problem

- A commanding general must send an order to his $n-1$ lieutenant generals such that
  - All loyal lieutenants obey the same order
  - If the commanding general is loyal, then every loyal lieutenant obeys the order he sends

# Byzantine Generals Problem

- distributed systems in real life
  - need to deal with failure or conflicting behaviours of its components
  - need consensus on the distributed state
- fun fact: *Lamport: "I have long felt that, because it was posed as a cute problem about philosophers seated around a table, Dijkstra's dining philosopher's problem received much more attention than it deserves."*

# Asnchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)

- What does Byzantine mean?
  - will reach consensus
  - know when consensus reached
  - consensus never changes
- Assumptions
  - attacker controls < 1/3 (theoretical limit)
  - attacker controls the network
    - messages between honest nodes eventually get through
    - asynchronous BFT -> no assumptions on the timing

# Distributed Consensus Algorithms

- Proof-of-work (Bitcoin, Ethereum)
  - slow (10 transactions per second)
  - waste of energy ($1M/day ~ Mauritius energy consumption)
- Proof-of-stake (Ethereum Casper)
  - much lower energy consumption
- Leader-based (Hyperledger Fabric)
  - Paxos, Raft, PBFT
- Voting-based (no implementation)
  - excellent theoretical properties
  - high bandwidth requirements $O(n^2)$

# What is hashgraph?

Hashgraph is a data structure and consensus algorithm that is:

- Fast: With a very high throughput and low consensus latency
- Secure: Asynchronous Byzantine fault tolerant
- Fair: Fairness of access, ordering, and timestamps

These properties enable new decentralized applications such as a stock market, improved collaborative applications, real-time multiplayer games, and auctions.

# Interesting characteristics

- absolute confirmation of transactions (unlike proof of work)
- fair order of transactions (compare with proof of work where transaction order is determined by miners)
- no wasted computation (compare with blockchain forking)
- just gossip and everything will work (low overhead)
- really fast virtual voting (no additional comms for consensus)

# Intuition of how hashgraph works

- order transactions by the time a majority of the nodes learns about it (thru the gossips)
  - must be 2/3 or more, received by 50% is not good enough when 1/3 are attackers
- famous witnesses are like well-known and trusted events, and simplifies the computation
- strongly seeing protects against forking, so no attacker can cheat by creating multiple famous witnesses in a single round

---

# Challenges of Growing Hashgraph

- Non-permissioned network
  - consensus with dynamic number of members
- Scaling
  - performance of large networks
- Licensing
  - barrier to adoption
  - reactions of dev community
- Language
  - java only?
  - porting to other languages (but this is not open source)
